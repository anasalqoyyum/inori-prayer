Each of them has an important role, especially in the mother (wife) because it is generally the most authoritative mother in forming a good household (saki>nah). This paper will introduce how the role of women in the household perspective of the Islam.

While the role of women as a mother at least there are three points as well; containing children, childbirth and breastfeeding, and nurturing and educating children.'

				abstract:
					'Textual understanding of the hadith about “creation of woman from the ribs” leads to the understanding that woman are under male domination. This position causes woman’s movements and rights to be narrow and limited. This is certainly contrary to the values of justice as basic principle of Islam. Therefore, a review of this hadith needs to be understood metaphorically. Hadith about “creation of woman from the ribs” actually aims to increase the degree and dignity of woman, positioned as a life partner. So that realtions between man and woman can be created in harmony by protecting and respecting each other.'

				abstract: `Muslim society perception of gender issues are influenced and constructed based on their religious understanding. Oftentimes, controversy arises because of difference in perspective regarding the discussion. One of factual problem that is often questioned is the discourse about women's participation in the sport. Therefore this paper was made by making the above polemic as an academic problem that was answered based on the epistemological fundamental of the hadith, specifically using the Fazlur Rahman’s hermeneutic method of Hadith. From the research that has been done it was found that Islam affirms sporting activity for women both the activity is carried out as an ordinary physical routine, and it is occupied as a field of work as a female athlete whose pioneering sport activity for self-career development. This validity is obtained by women with several prerequisites : 1). Comply with religious norms, decency, and other consideration such as medical procedure in their activity so as to avoid the emergence of adverse effect or loss-material and immaterial-to personal and other people. 2). Balancing the division of time between sport activity and other routines that also have crucial value.`

					'This article aims at analysing the misogynistic hadith of the prophet which contains the command of the wife prostrate to the husband. The understanding of the Hadith textually is claimed by some fraction as a misogynistic hadith, in which these hadiths allegedly contain content that degrading women. Through the concept of hermeneutics Hans[1]George Gadamer which has been meaningfulness as an appropriate solution, the command of the wife prostrate to the husband is not a misogynistic hadith that is to degrade women and put men in the front position. The concept of Hermeneutics Gadamer, which includes the theory of understanding, interpretation, and application, replied that the hadith implies the removal of the degree of women by providing an understanding to fulfil the rights and obligations between husband and wife, and be kind to each other. This is what distinguishes understanding in the book of hadith that is explained only by the text with the history.'

				abstract:
					'This study departs from a compilation of women-themed hadiths that were interpreted progresively by Abdul Kodir in his book “60 Hadis Hak-Hak Perempuan Dalam Islam:Teks dan Interpretasi”. Another starting used to study this topic is because women-themed hadiths tend to affrim men’ssuperiority over women. Of the sixty hadith that have been interpreted, the researcher only chose a few hadiths, which are categorized in four major themes; the principle of male and female relations, women’s dignity, women’s choices and rights, and the relations of husband and wife. This study tries to learn and analyze how Abdul Kodir applies the theory of qira’ahmubadalah to these selected hadiths. The approach of this study are conceptual approach and content analysis approach. This study finds that qira’ah mubadalah is a progressive interpretation theory that relies on two things, the universal value of Islam and the substantial understanding of a text. Dialecting both things will be able to produce interpretations that carry the value of equality holistically. In the application level, Abdul Kodir has integrated Islamic universalism in understanding the substance of the text.'

				abstract: `One discourse that is always taken into account in the Islamic world is the leadership of women in society. Patriarchal societies that always look down on women will always reject this discourse. In Islam, there are at least 3 groups in interpreting this discourse. First, the fundamentalists who always refuse, because they believe that a woman should only reign an internal household. Second, the liberal groups that are completely following western ideas, such as gender equality, feminism, secularism and so on. Third, the progressive groups who tend to be more careful in accepting concepts from the Western ideas before making corrections and criticisms.This article will explore the point of view of the well-known Syrian figure, Sa'id Ramadhan al[1]Buthi in understanding the concept of women's leadership in misogynistic hadiths. According to al-Būṭī, it is permissible for women to become a leader as long as they fulfil the 2 criteria, namely: a) Women who are nominated for this job must have the required expertise, so that they can carry out the job properly. This condition is between the men and women; b) The workload should not neglect the syaria (Islamic law) and they must still obey the ethics. Keywords: Women Leaders, Gender, Islam`

				abstract:
					'This article explains how the construction of the hermeneutical reason of hadith scholars related to the hadith of the prophet that mentions the prohibition of women travels without a mahram. Using the sociological and historical approach, and hermeneutic analysis, the f ndings point to the conclusion that the hadith exists with a diverse narrative, especially related to the boundary radius of distance and travel time. To understand this hadith, scholars need to analyze further and interpret the hadith based on the context, not merely on its literal text. To conclude their interpretation, the prohibition of women travelling without their mahramsis related to comfort and safety. A mahram can either be replaced or removed when the situation is already safe. In other words, the role of a mahramis considered more on its functional instead of its existential aspect. Despite the use of hermeneutics approach by contemporary scholars to sustain the existing studies, this study still becomes a critique since the offer is not entirely new. Previous scholars have used this hermeneutic approach, and since their understanding is contextually based on their own era, diverse interpretation is inevitable.'

				abstract: `This article focuses on the interpretation of the prohibition of women traveling without mahram hadith and the prohibition on writing which is often understood textually as the editors of the hadith. The literature review method with descriptive qualitative analysis through contingent analysis of the perspective of the socio-historical and anthropological approaches used in this article. The findings of this study are: (1) The legislation of the ban on women traveling alone if they look at the historical context of the above hadith is security and propriety, the current contextualization is if the security of women traveling alone is guaranteed and women are deemed appropriate more taboo when traveling alone, it does not matter if women travel alone without mahram, (2) Rationes legis from prohibiting the painting of animate creatures, namely the fear of the emergence of shirk by worshiping paintings or sculptures as in the time of ignorance. This prohibition in the concept of usul fiqh can be categorized as sadd al-dzari'ah which is to cut the path of damage (mafsadah) as a way to avoid such damage, in other words it is an anticipatory step.`

				abstract: `The textual reading of the Prophet's hadith about the relationship between men and women often results in discriminatory and subordinating attitudes towards certain genders. This article aims to reread the hadith about the relationship between men and women. It emphasizes the disclosure of prophetic Maqasid or the orientation and purpose of prophethood in the hadith. This study uses a descriptive-analytical method by criticizing the traditions about the relationship between men and women contained in the books of Sunan Abi Dawud, al-Tirmidzi, and al-Darimi. The result shows that revealing the prophetic Maqasid in these traditions is urgent considering that the purpose of Muhammad's sending was to spread love to the universe based on monotheism (Tawhid). Tawhid is not only a verbal statement. It becomes the main foundation in building a socio-political-cultural order that promotes equality and balance between men and women. A balanced and harmonious relationship between the two becomes the Maqasid of the Prophet in every utterance and policy he established. The balance of relations between men and women by relying on a correct and comprehensive understanding of the hadith of the Prophet opens opportunities for women to perform and play the roles that need them for the good of humanity universally.`

				abstract: `Tulisan ini membahas tentang kepemimpinan perempuan dalam hukum Islam berdasarkan Hadits tentang kepemimpinan perempuan. Dalam tulisan ini dijelaskan bahwa Hadits yang melarang tentang Kepemimpinan Perempuan memiliki korelasi dengan hancurnya Kerajaan Persia yang ketika itu dipimpin oleh seorang perempuan. Dari konteks ini kemudian masalah mengenai Kepemimpinan Perempuan melahirkan dua pandangan, yaitu yang menyetujui dan menolaknya. Bagi yang setuju dengan Kepemimpinan perempuan, mereka berpandangan bahwa Hadits tersebut bersifat kontekstual dan berlaku untuk saat itu. Karenanya, Hadits tersebut sifatnya tidak universal atau larangannya berlaku untuk semua perempuan. Bagi yang menolaknya, mereka berpandangan bahwa Hadits yang melarang tentang Kepemimpinan Perempuan berlaku tidak hanya untuk konteks masa lalu, tetapi berlaku pula untuk segala zaman. Dari kedua pendapat ini terlihat bahwa masalah Kepemimpinan Perempuan sampai saat ini masih melahirkan perdebatan, satu sisi banyak yang setuju dengan Kepemimpinan Perempuan, di sisi lain tidak sedikit yang menolaknya.`

				abstract: `Hadith for women is prohibited without a mahram, including one of the topics of hadith that is quite well known, not only for hadith experts, but also warm among jurists. certain, believe that women are prohibited from going without a mahram, other parts of the hadith are temporal so that they are not relevant to use in the current situation and situation. Because the hadith describes the conditions at the time of the Prophet and his companions, not the current conditions. This paper compares the hadith that is forbidden without a mahram with the hadith that can be used by women without a mahram. Then it will try to give a new meaning (reinterpretation) based on the compromise results of the hadiths that seem "opposite" and are studied with a feminist approach with the aim of giving birth to a new understanding so that religious texts, especially regarding nature without a mahram, do not seem to shackle women. The type of method used in this research is qualitative with the approach of Socialist Feminism, where gender occurs because of the ancient capitalist system and the domination over women. This paper concludes that the hadith about for a woman without a mahram is tentative and is the impact of the class structure in the Arab world first. This had an impact on gender and sexually subordinated women at that time.`

				abstract: `This article aims to find out how to understand women's leadership by using a sociological approach in this case the theory of social change. Because the hadith cannot be separated from the background of the emergence of hadith (ashbāb al-wurūd) and the social life of each place and time can be different and can change. In this case, the study used is qualitative and literature, and the method used is descriptive analysis, first describing the text about women's leadership, then describing the analysis using a social change theory approach. The result of the explanation obtained is that the social changes that occur make women the same opportunities as men in various fields such as politics and leadership. And female leaders have a leadership style that is lacking in men (and vice versa) which makes them complementary. Keywords: Leadership, Women, Social Change`

				asal: 'Universitas Islam Negeri Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta',
				contact: 'nurun.najwah@uin-suka.ac.id',
				abstract: `The dehumanization of women in the religious framework in the media is in the form of defining women as "free" human beings. The narrative is strongly framed because it is socialized by the da'i (male) and the da'iyah. There have not been many studies that have paid attention to the substance of religion, how the da'iyah (women preachers) are actively and massively involved in delivering their da'wah material which translates women, not as creatures that need to be humanized based on religious doctrine through the lectures of three da'iyah Mamah Dedeh (Dedeh Rosdiana); dr. Aisyah Dahlan and Dr. Oki Setiana Dewi through the youtube channel in six contents. Three questions were posed: (1) How are (religious) values regarding the dehumanization of women presented in religious lectures in the media; (2) How is the role of da'iyah in influencing the dehumanization of women; (3) How is the media contestation in religious lectures that do not humanize women. Misinterpretations in the form of dehumanization of women by the da'iyah are generally caused by a literal, partial, and superficial reading of religious doctrines. Therefore, although it is realized that the ideology of the media is never in line with religious values that are humanist and full of moral messages, religious lectures in the media need to be studied carefully, so that religious messages that are "more humane for women" through the media are not denied.`

				abstract: `Women taking on leading roles is a common occurrence in many parts of the world today. So, we need to know the rules of a group or organization led by a woman, as well as the rules of a very big country. This paper mostly talks about three things. The first is about the verses in the Qur'an and the sayings of the Prophet that, when looked at lafadz, show that women can't be in charge. This will be described in more detail. In the second discussion, a verse is given that scholars use to say that a woman can lead a group, organization, or state. This is followed by the scholars' interpretations of these verses, which can be used as evidence that a woman can be a leader. Then, in the last discussion, stories were told about women in charge, because this isn't a new thing. It's been happening since ancient times, which makes us sure and think that a woman can be in charge of an organization.`

Whereas marriage is a very strong bond and the longest worship in life, therefore as Muslims we must follow the guidance of the Prophet, remembering that Rasulullah SAW is our example. Making the values in this hadith very important, steps must be taken to revitalize these values. One of them is by analyzing several hadiths which explain the terms and conditions of khitbah in Islam. For this study the authors used qualitative methods with thematic study analysis. The author’s object is to discuss the values in the hadith and how to maintain the glory of women. Where the results of this literature research explain that the purpose of the prophet’s hadiths is to glorify women and not even be rigid in providing protection for the rights and obligations of husbands and wives.
